# country-capital-microservice
Design and implement a simple microservice using Spring Boot and Java to manage country-capital information. The microservice should expose two APIs: one for saving country-capital pairs to a MySQL database and another for retrieving the capital of a specific country from the database. Basic Authentication should be implemented to secure the APIs.
